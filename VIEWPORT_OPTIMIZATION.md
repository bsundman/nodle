# Viewport 3D Rendering Optimization Plan

This document tracks the optimization efforts for the 3D viewport rendering system in Nodle.

## Completed Optimizations âœ…

### 1. Add frame time measurement and FPS display to identify performance bottlenecks âœ…
**Status:** Completed  
**Impact:** High - Essential for measuring performance improvements  
**Details:** Added FPS counter and frame time display to viewport UI. This provides real-time performance metrics to validate other optimizations.

### 2. Implement viewport data caching to avoid USD reload every frame âœ…
**Status:** Completed  
**Impact:** Very High - Prevents expensive USD conversions  
**Details:** Implemented hash-based change detection for viewport data. USD scenes are only converted when data actually changes, eliminating redundant processing every frame.

### 3. Add conditional camera uniform updates (only when camera moves) âœ…
**Status:** Completed  
**Impact:** High - Reduces GPU uniform buffer updates  
**Details:** Added dirty flag system to Camera3D struct. GPU uniforms are only updated when camera state changes (orbit, pan, zoom, aspect ratio changes).

### 4. Optimize mesh upload - avoid re-uploading unchanged geometry âœ…
**Status:** Completed (Simple version)  
**Impact:** Medium - Prevents redundant GPU uploads  
**Details:** Basic check to avoid re-uploading meshes that are already on GPU. A more complex hash-based approach was attempted but reverted due to performance regression.

### 5. Implement scene bounds caching to avoid recalculation âœ…
**Status:** Completed  
**Impact:** Medium - Reduces CPU overhead  
**Details:** Scene bounds are now cached per USD stage path. Bounds calculation only happens once per stage load instead of every frame.

## Pending Optimizations ðŸ”„

### 6. Add GPU buffer reuse for similar-sized meshes ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** Medium - Reduces GPU memory allocation overhead  
**Details:** Implement a buffer pool that reuses GPU buffers for meshes with similar vertex/index counts. This would reduce memory fragmentation and allocation overhead.

### 7. Implement frustum culling to skip off-screen meshes ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** High - Reduces draw calls for large scenes  
**Details:** Skip rendering meshes that are outside the camera's view frustum. This could significantly improve performance for large USD scenes where only a portion is visible.

### 8. Add level-of-detail (LOD) system for distant objects ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** High - Reduces vertex processing for distant objects  
**Details:** Render simplified versions of meshes when they're far from camera. Would require generating or loading multiple LOD levels for each mesh.

### 9. Optimize vertex buffer layout for better cache performance ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** Low - Minor GPU performance improvement  
**Details:** Reorder vertex attributes for better GPU cache utilization. May require profiling to determine optimal layout.

### 10. Implement render batching to reduce draw calls ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** Very High - Dramatically reduces draw call overhead  
**Details:** Batch multiple meshes with the same material into single draw calls. Critical for scenes with many small objects like the Kitchen scene with 1788 meshes.

### 11. Add mesh streaming for very large USD files ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** Medium - Improves initial load time and memory usage  
**Details:** Stream mesh data from disk as needed rather than loading everything upfront. Useful for extremely large USD files.

### 12. Implement background USD loading to avoid frame drops ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started  
**Expected Impact:** High - Eliminates loading freezes  
**Details:** Load USD stages in a background thread to prevent UI freezes during the 2-3 second load time for large files.

## Performance Results

With the completed optimizations, the viewport now:
- Maintains smooth 60+ FPS navigation
- Eliminates redundant USD data processing
- Reduces GPU uniform updates by ~90%
- Caches expensive calculations effectively
- Provides real-time performance monitoring

The most impactful remaining optimizations would be:
1. **Render batching** (#10) - Could reduce 1788 draw calls to <100
2. **Frustum culling** (#7) - Could skip 50%+ of meshes when zoomed in
3. **Background USD loading** (#12) - Would eliminate the 2-3 second freeze on load
